            Short description
===================================================

This file contains the necessary to model an admixture scenario
between n populations. In include are the necesseray class that 
define :

Mathematical vectors : Vecteur.hpp
Genotype and its probability : Genotype.hpp
Panmixie - Random mating mixing : Panmixie.hpp
Selection - Effect of the selection matrix Phi : Selection.hpp

The simulation is run in main, may be soon in Simulate_admixture.hpp

===================================================
            Protocol to run the program
===================================================

1) Open the terminal in the distribution_cpp folder

2) Run "make" without quotation mark

3) Run the newly created executable using "./distribution_cpp" in the terminal without quotation mark
